# 🚀 Machine Learning Projects  

This repository contains various machine learning projects demonstrating regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning techniques. Each project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using industry-standard tools.  

## 📈 Regression Models  
- **🔹 Linear Regression** – A basic predictive modeling technique for understanding feature relationships and making continuous predictions.  
- **🔹 Multiple Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression** – Regularization techniques to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.  
- **🔹 Gradient Boosting and Random Forest Regression** – Ensemble methods that enhance predictive accuracy by combining multiple models.  

## 🔍 Classification Models  
- **📊 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – A dimensionality reduction technique to improve model efficiency while retaining essential variance.  
- **🎯 Classification Models** – Various supervised learning techniques for categorizing data and evaluating model performance.  

## 🤖 Deep Learning and Clustering  
- **🧠 Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** – A deep learning model using fully connected neural networks for classification and regression tasks.  
- **🌍 DBSCAN Clustering** – A density-based clustering algorithm for detecting anomalies and identifying complex patterns.  
- **📌 K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** – Unsupervised learning techniques for segmenting data into meaningful clusters.
